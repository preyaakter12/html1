	<p>With GitHub Copilot Free you get 2000 code completions/month. That's about 80 per working day - which is a lot. You also get 50 chat requests/month, as well as access to both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.

If you hit these limits, ideally it's because Copilot is doing its job well, which is to help you do yours! If you find you need more Copilot, the paid Pro plan is unlimited and provides access to additional models like o1 and Gemini (coming in the new year).

With this announcement, GitHub Copilot becomes a core part of the VS Code experience. The team has been hard at work, as always, improving that experience with brand new AI features and capabilities. Letâ€™s take a look at some of the newer additions to GitHub Copilot that dropped in just the past few months. This is your editor, redefined with AI.</p>
